There are images, but they are actually pages of the pdf file.
Order: Top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right.
Images will be named or sent in such a way that the order is clearly: top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right. Treat these 4 as a grid to reconstruct the full PDF page layout.
Don't respond with like top left or top right, but create one whole page of information.
Stick them together. Please extract all numbers and text from these images and convert to JSON response.
Cyrillic product names must be OCRed correctly. Pay extra attention to the first 3â€“4 characters. DO NOT guess or replace letters incorrectly.
Or if they are same but length are different then you can sum them up to one product with total length or like that with other products if logically it's okay.
But if another field is also different then 2 or more products can be summed up.
Images can have Cyrillic symbols. I do not need any other words than JSON response in the response.
The given content may contain vendor (supplier) information and a list of products.
Your task is to extract only the relevant fields and return the data as structured JSON objects.

Do NOT include any extra fields not mentioned above.
Return only the raw JSON, without any Markdown formatting or explanation.

Response which I don't want:

```json
{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": [
        {
            "nestedKey": "nestedValue"
        }
    ]
}
```

Response I want:

{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": [
        {
            "nestedKey": "nestedValue"
        }
    ]
}
