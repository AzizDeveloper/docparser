You are given 4 images that represent one page of a PDF. The image layout is:

- Top left
- Top right
- Bottom left
- Bottom right

Treat them as a 2x2 grid forming a full page, and combine their contents accordingly.

Each image may contain vendor information and a product list. Your task is to extract only the **relevant vendor and product data**, then return the result as **raw JSON only** ‚Äî with no markdown formatting, no explanations.

---

PHASE 1 ‚Äî OCR Extraction (CRITICAL):

- Carefully extract all visible Cyrillic text, **preserving characters as they appear**.
- Pay extra attention to similar Cyrillic characters like:
  - `–î` vs `–õ`
  - `–ó` vs `3`
- DO NOT guess, normalize, or autocorrect. Use exactly what you see in the image.
- DO NOT skip any rows that resemble a product, even if some fields are incomplete.
- Preserve line order and numbers with precision.
- Do not apply any logic at this stage ‚Äî just extract all potential product rows and vendor fields.

PHASE 2 ‚Äî Data Structuring and Logic:

### ‚úÖ Vendor fields (skip if not found):
- `name`: String  
- `description`: String  
- `email`: String  
- `district`: String  
- `city`: String  
- `address`: String  
- `contactName`: String  
- `deliveryTime`: Integer

### ‚úÖ Product fields:
- `code`: String  
- `productName`: String  
- `internalProducts`: List<Product>  
- `productLevel`: ProductLevel  
- `price`: BigDecimal  
- `amount`: BigDecimal  
- `warehouse`: String  
- `materialMeasureType`: MaterialMeasureType

### üß© Enums:

#### `ProductLevel`:
- `LEVEL_1` = raw materials  
- `LEVEL_2` = detail  
- `LEVEL_3` = finished product  

#### `MaterialMeasureType`:
UNITS - –ï–¥.–∏–∑–º. - –ï–¥–∏–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ –∏–∑–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è, or —à—Ç - —à—Ç—É–∫
WEIGHTED_KILO - –∫–≥ - –∫–∏–ª–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º
WEIGHTED_GRAM - –≥ - –≥—Ä–∞–º–º
VOLUME_L - –ª - –ª–∏—Ç—Ä
VOLUME_ML - –º–ª - –º–∏–ª–ª–∏–ª–∏—Ç—Ä
SQUARE_M - –º¬≤ - –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–π –º–µ—Ç—Ä
LINEAR_METERS - –ø.–º. - –ø–æ–≥–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –º–µ—Ç—Ä—ã
CUBIC_M - –º¬≥ - –∫—É–±–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –º–µ—Ç—Ä
TONS - —Ç - —Ç–æ–Ω–Ω–∞

MANDATORY LOGIC:

1. Group products by `productName` only. **Ignore the `code` field** during grouping.
2. If `productName` differs only by dashes or spacing, treat as identical.
3. If productNames are same then **sum the total amount**.
4. Merge lengths or weights logically when units allow (e.g., weight * amount or length * amount).
5. Use only one materialMeasureType per product.
6. If a product has internal components, place them in `internalProducts`.
7. If a product is labeled as `LEVEL_2` or `LEVEL_3` but has no `internalProducts`, demote it to `LEVEL_1`.
8. If hierarchy is unclear, assign the largest product as `LEVEL_3` and others as `LEVEL_1` and nest them.
9. Do NOT include totals, titles, metadata rows, or unrelated text.
10. Do not add or guess anything. Use only data present in the image.

---

### Output rules:

- Output raw JSON only.
- If no relevant product or vendor data found: `No relevant data found`
- If image has no text at all: `No text data found`
