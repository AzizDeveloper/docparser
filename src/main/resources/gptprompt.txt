There are images, but they are actually pages of the pdf file.
Order: Top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right. Every 4 images are 1 pdf page.
Don't respond with like top left or top right, but create one whole page of information.
Stick them together. Please extract all numbers and text from these images and convert to JSON response.
If products or items have the same name then attach its unique field to its name.
Or if they are same but length are different then you can sum them up to one product with total length or like that with other products if logically it's okay.
But if another field is also different then 2 or more products can be summed up.
Images can have Cyrillic symbols. I do not need any other words than JSON response in the response.
The given content may contain vendor (supplier) information and a list of products.
Your task is to extract only the relevant fields and return the data as structured JSON objects.

Ignore any unrelated data.
If there are no relevant data then respond: No relevant data found.
If you couldn't read the file properly or text doesn't exist then respond: No text data found.

Vendor fields to extract (skip missing fields if not found):

name : String
description : String
email : String
district : String
city : String
address : String
contactName : String
deliveryTime : Integer

Product fields to extract (can be multiple products, skip missing fields):
code : String
productName : String
List<ProductType> internalProducts (if some products contain other products then it must be placed inside its internalProducts list)
ProductLevel productLevel
price : BigDecimal
amount : BigDecimal
warehouse : String
materialMeasureType : String

ProductLevel is enum class and its values: LEVEL_1, LEVEL_2, LEVEL_3

UNITS(1, amount, Amount, platform.measureTypes.units)
WEIGHTED_KILO(2, kg, KG, platform.measureTypes.weighted_kilo)
WEIGHTED_GRAM(3, gr, GR, platform.measureTypes.weighted_gram)
VOLUME_L(4, ltr, LTR, platform.measureTypes.volume_litres)
VOLUME_ML(5, ml, ML, platform.measureTypes.volume_mLitres)
SQUARE_M(6, square meters, sq. m, platform.measureTypes.square_meters)
LINEAR_METERS(7, linear meters, ln. m, platform.measureTypes.linear_meters)
CUBIC_M(8, cubic meters, cub. m, platform.measureTypes.cubic_meters)
TONS(9, tons, t, platform.measureTypes.tons)

platform.measureTypes.name = Ед.изм. - means Единица измерения
platform.measureTypes.units = шт - штук
platform.measureTypes.weighted_kilo = кг - килограмм
platform.measureTypes.weighted_gram = г - грамм
platform.measureTypes.volume_litres = л - литр
platform.measureTypes.volume_mLitres = мл - миллилитр
platform.measureTypes.square_meters = м² - квадратный метр
platform.measureTypes.linear_meters = п.м. - погонные метры
platform.measureTypes.cubic_meters = м³ - кубический метр
platform.measureTypes.tons = т - тонна

When creating result use those enums like UNITS or TONS or etc, not raw т or кг

MANDATORY LOGIC:

There are 3 levels:

LEVEL_1: Raw Materials
LEVEL_2: Detail (must be made ONLY from LEVEL_1)
LEVEL_3: Finished Product (can be made from LEVEL_1 and/or LEVEL_2)

If a product (LEVEL_2 or LEVEL_3) does NOT contain internalProducts (i.e., sub-components), then it must be considered a LEVEL_1 product instead.
If there is no clear description about which product is what level then main product is level 3 and others level 1 and use nested structure.
If it's not level2 or level3 then all products must be nested to higher level products.

You must logically detect which items are actual products. Ignore rows or items that are clearly not products (e.g., headers, metadata, or totals).

Product names must be exactly preserved. Never alter digits, letters, or symbols in any way.
If multiple products have the same or very similar name (e.g., same Cyrillic root word), sum their amounts.
When merging names do not add anything from yourself only use from image/file data.

If weight, lengths (millimeter or centimeter → convert them to meter) and amount are given, calculate their total amount = length × amount and put measure type to meter. Then group by product name and sum.
How do you know the length is meter or centimeter or millimeter explain that in the ending.

In the final Products list, return ONLY valid products — no extra image data, no unrelated rows, no totals.

Cyrillic product names must be OCRed correctly. Pay extra attention to the first 3–4 characters. DO NOT guess or replace letters incorrectly.
Do NOT include any extra fields not mentioned above.
